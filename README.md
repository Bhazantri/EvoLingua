## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated components (MLA, MoE, MTP) for easy experimentation and modification.
- **Scalability**: Supports distributed training with PyTorch Distributed and DeepSpeed integration.
- **Efficiency**: Simulated FP8 precision (full support with NVIDIA Transformer Engine) and low-rank attention compression.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Incorporates auxiliary-loss-free load balancing and multi-token prediction.
- **Customizability**: Configurable hyperparameters via `config.py`.

## Technical Overview
EvoLingua is designed to emulate the scale and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), with an estimated parameter count of up to 671 billion (37 billion active per token) when fully scaled. It leverages:
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: A hybrid of shared and routed experts, with dynamic load balancing to optimize compute efficiency.
- **Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)**: Compresses key-value caches for reduced memory footprint while maintaining performance.
- **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)**: Predicts multiple future tokens in a single pass, improving generation speed and coherence.

The model is built to handle long contexts (up to 128,000 tokens) and supports mixed-precision training (FP8/FP16) for high throughput on modern GPUs.

  - CPU: 8-core processor (e.g., Intel i7, AMD Ryzen 7)
  - RAM: 64GB
  - Storage: 500GB SSD (for model weights and small datasets)
