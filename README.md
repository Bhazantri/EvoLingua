EvoLingua: A Scalable Mixture-of-Experts Language Model Framework
EvoLingua is an open-source PyTorch implementation of a large-scale, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model inspired by advanced architectures in natural language processing research. It features Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for efficient attention mechanisms, a custom MoE design with auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) for enhanced generation capabilities. Designed for researchers, EvoLingua provides a modular and extensible framework to experiment with cutting-edge language modeling techniques, supporting FP8 precision and distributed training. This project aims to democratize access to state-of-the-art model designs for academic and industrial exploration.


# EvoLingua: A Scalable Mixture-of-Experts Language Model Framework


EvoLingua is an advanced, open-source PyTorch implementation of a large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model, inspired by cutting-edge NLP research. It integrates Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for efficient attention mechanisms, a custom MoE architecture with auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) for enhanced generative capabilities. Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, EvoLingua serves as a robust framework for researchers and engineers to explore state-of-the-art language modeling techniques, supporting FP8 precision, distributed training, and customizable configurations.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated components (MLA, MoE, MTP) for easy experimentation and modification.
- **Scalability**: Supports distributed training with PyTorch Distributed and DeepSpeed integration.
- **Efficiency**: Simulated FP8 precision (full support with NVIDIA Transformer Engine) and low-rank attention compression.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Incorporates auxiliary-loss-free load balancing and multi-token prediction.
- **Customizability**: Configurable hyperparameters via `config.py`.

## Technical Overview
EvoLingua is designed to emulate the scale and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), with an estimated parameter count of up to 1 billion ( 10 million active per token) when fully scaled. It leverages:
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: A hybrid of shared and routed experts, with dynamic load balancing to optimize compute efficiency.
- **Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)**: Compresses key-value caches for reduced memory footprint while maintaining performance.
- **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)**: Predicts multiple future tokens in a single pass, improving generation speed and coherence.

The model is built to handle long contexts (up to 128,000 tokens) and supports mixed-precision training (FP8/FP16) for high throughput on modern GPUs.
